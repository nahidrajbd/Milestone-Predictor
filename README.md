Milestone Predictor is a simple and user-friendly web app designed to help users estimate key life milestones. By entering either the **year of birth** or the **year of high school completion**, the app calculates when someone might have started school, completed various education levels, and graduated, along with the predicted job expiry age of 30. The app is tailored to follow the educational timeline in Bangladesh, offering approximate results for better planning and understanding.

The app calculates milestones such as the start of schooling at age 6, the completion of primary school in 5 years, high school in another 5 years, higher secondary school in 2 years, and graduation in 4-5 years. For users who might not remember their birth year, entering the year they completed high school allows the app to backtrack and estimate their birth year as well.

With its clean interface, Milestone Predictor ensures the results are displayed in an organized and easy-to-read format. The results section is designed with proper spacing and alignment to clearly separate each milestone, making it accessible and straightforward for users.

A small footer credits the developer, **Nahid**, and includes a "Learn More" link. Clicking this link opens a popup explaining the purpose of the app and how it works. This adds transparency and provides additional context for first-time users.
